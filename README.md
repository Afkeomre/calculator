# Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator built using Vue.js. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it includes several useful features like decimal calculations, a reset button, and a toggle for switching between positive and negative numbers.
